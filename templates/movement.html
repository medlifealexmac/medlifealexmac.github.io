            <p>MEDLIFE (Medicine, Education, and Development for Low Income Families Everywhere) is a non-profit organization focused on developing impoverished communities located in South America and Africa, by creating various projects that provide sustainable solutions to improving the living conditions of numerous families. To fund for such projects, volunteers and students around the world, such as ourselves, are recruited to spread the MEDLIFE movement.</p>
            <p>An exceptional opportunity that is offered to students by MEDLIFE is the week-long Service Learning Trips (SLT). Participants of these SLT visit a partnered community with MEDLIFE to personally volunteer in aiding the local community in its mobile medical clinics or with its development projects. This trip allows students and volunteers to witness the effects of poverty first hand and be able to do their part in evolving a community’s way of life from a bottom-up approach without compromising their customs, culture, and way of life.</p>
            <p>MEDLIFE’s mission is to build a worldwide movement empowering the poor in their fight for equal access to healthcare, education, and a safe home. Our chapter and the MEDLIFE organisation are striving to see a world free from the constraints of poverty.</p>
