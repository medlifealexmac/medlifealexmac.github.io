            <p>MEDLIFE chapters are smaller branches of the MEDLIFE organization that can be found in many high schools and universities throughout Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and South America. These chapters are run by students in an inclusive environment where members contribute to the MEDLIFE Movement.</p>
            <p>Our chapter is currently run by an executive team of six students whose roles include managing marketing, creating graphics for social media, delivery of information through different means of communication, and special event planning for fundraising activities in our local community. In essence, we act as the liaison between representatives of higher branches in the MEDLIFE organization and other members of the chapter.</p>
            <p>General members of our Alexander Mackenzie High School chapter play an important part in ensuring a chapter’s success. They volunteer during fundraising and MEDLIFE-related events, in which they receive volunteer hours, and attend chapter meetings to stay up-to-date on the chapter’s agenda and progress. General members are also encouraged to participate in our chapter’s Service Learning Trips, which ordinarily takes place during March break in Peru. This trip is an incredible opportunity for students to learn about the effects of a lack of medicine, education and general facilities  on a low-income community. Participants of SLT can directly contribute to the development of these communities and bring home unforgettable stories and memories from their trip.</p>
